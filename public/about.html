                    CodeHaven is a safe space for children to learn and grow in
                    the computer science field. With our groundbreaking technology,
                    we are able to have children create, play, and learn all from one place.
                    With this in mind, there are no limitations and 
                    no way a child can be left behind. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Since our launch date, we have seen tremendous growth in the minority and
                    underrepresented community. 80% of students go on to continue in the computer
                    science field. 60% of students are girls and 75% of those girls are of color. 
                    77% of students are from underrepresented communities where they may have
                    not had the resources to access this site.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Now we know that not every student has access to a laptop, so what are we doing to
                    help? We are partnering up with libraries nationally to connect with students. 
                    This will allow them to access this site through their local library and receive additional
                    one-to-one support. Aditionally, we have teamed with companies like VMware and Dell to
                    provide laptopbs and other technology based devices to allow students to learn right from
                    their home! About 65% of the students in CodeHaven have been connected with our sponsors
                    and have succesfully received laptops and such to access our site! We are working towards
                    increasing this percentage and have 100% of our students with our sponsored laptops!
